In modern day communication, the ideal is to have absolutely secure communication. This market need has necessitated the advancement of cryptography. The ideal cryptographic algorithms are supposed to be near impossible to crack. However, ideal secure communication systems do not exist since there may be some undetected security flaw that make the system vulnerable to hackers. Many systems are highly susceptible to brute force attacks and social engineering. The next best alternative is to make the algorithm as difficult to crack as possible. The AES algorithm is currently the most secure in that it is has not yet been cracked. Further security is ensured by utilizing a keypad password at the end-points so that only intended parties can read the encrypted message.
